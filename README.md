 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project**
 
 **Objective**

The main objective of this task was to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python to understand the structure, distribution, and patterns within the dataset.
Through this process, key insights were derived about the data’s characteristics, trends, and relationships.

**Tools & Libraries Used**

Python

Pandas – for data loading, cleaning, and manipulation

Matplotlib – for basic data visualization

Seaborn – for advanced and statistical visualizations

**Process Overview**

**1️ Data Preparation**

Loaded the dataset into Python using Pandas.

Checked for null values, duplicates, and inconsistent data.

Converted data types such as dates into proper formats.

Created new derived columns to assist in analysis (e.g., calculated durations or totals).

**2️ Exploratory Data Analysis**

Used statistical methods such as .describe(), .info(), and .value_counts() to understand the dataset.

Visualized the data using a combination of Matplotlib and Seaborn charts to identify trends and distributions.

Compared different categories and time-based patterns using bar charts, histograms, line charts, boxplots, and heatmaps.

Identified correlations between numerical variables and observed relationships between key fields.

**3️ Visualization**

Various charts were created to summarize and represent the data visually:

Bar charts – for comparing categorical data

Histograms – for understanding data distribution

Line charts – for trends over time

Boxplots – for identifying outliers and variability

Heatmaps – for correlation analysis

Pie charts – for percentage-based comparisons

**4️ Insights and Findings**

The data revealed clear trends and concentration in certain categories.

Some variables showed strong relationships, helping to identify key factors affecting performance.

Visualizations provided a deeper understanding of the dataset’s overall behavior and helped detect any anomalies or patterns.

**Outcome**

Gained hands-on experience in using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for exploratory data analysis.

Improved understanding of how to interpret data visually.

Learned to identify trends, relationships, and outliers effectively.

Built a clean and structured workflow for analyzing any dataset in the future.

**Deliverables**

Jupyter Notebook containing the complete analysis and visualizations.

PDF report summarizing findings and insights.
